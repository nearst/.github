### Opening up the world’s local shop inventory to shoppers nearby

That's our mission at NearSt - which we do by tracking and processing millions of inventory changes on a 
daily basis. Using this data, we help retailers do effective online marketing, gather new insights on what 
they should be stocking, and help local shops continue to be the backbone of our community.
